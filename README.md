## Overview

"Lomi" is an action-packed 2D game developed using Pygame. The game centers around two characters: a boy and a girl. The boy throws lemons while the girl runs and jumps to avoid them. The objective is to dodge as many lemons as possible to keep the girl alive. The game ends when the girl gets hit by a lemon.

## Features

- **Dynamic Background**: A scrolling background that creates an immersive environment.
- **Character Animation**: Both the boy and girl have smooth, animated sprites for running, throwing, jumping, and more.
- **Lemon Throwing**: Lemons are periodically thrown by the boy, with increasing difficulty as time progresses.
- **Sound Effects and Music**: The game includes background music, sound effects for jumping, and throwing lemons.
- **Start and Game Over Screens**: Interactive screens to start the game and restart after the game ends.

## Gameplay

2. **In-Game**:

    - Press the `SPACE` arrow key to make the girl jump and avoid the lemons.

3. **Game Over**:
